# Informations
I got really annoyed (and still am) and im just pissed because of what is all happening today. One of my friends became annoying recently because his friend (Lets call him User) unfriended him a while ago, and User re-added him, and he's someone i don't really like, and my friend has been going into his vibe again. Which is a vibe I don't like. Second, I deeply regret something (don't worry, its not too bad, and not what you think it is, Azor.) that has been happening for around a week or so. I'm pretty sure i lost a best friend which i was friends with for around 3-4 years. The year is almost ending and soon enough i'll say goodbyes to my best school friend, since they're not gonna live where i am anymore. I'm just bored, There's nothing for me to do, It feels like I can't really do anything, I played alot today, and I don\'tt want to play anymore, I barely play roblox because of what's happening, and also because there's no good games out there, I was playing minecraft, but im bored of it atm, because there's nothing for me to do in it, I already played survival and trained a (really) little of mace pvp. I could say i have no friends, but not exactly, as i mean by that is that i dont really have friends that talks to me alot and stuff. I don't know if this makes sense or not, just forget i typed this, moving on, Discord, Idk, i've been in discord since 2019, and I gotta say, it changed my life a lot. But i think its time for me to do a small breaks i used to do rarely, where it was a chance where i'd just get on in a hour again. Idk anymore, Just, goodbye for now, I'll prob get on in a few hours or minutes. I really don't know. Bye!
